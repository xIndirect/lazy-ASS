Hey everyone! It's Indirect again bringing you Lazy-ASS v 1.0

What does it do? It allows you to install your apks to your /system folder before you flash a rom so then you dont need to wait for Titanium Backup to run!


What do I do?
You need to do adb pull /data/app and go through and select whatever apps you want to insert into the system folder and put it in the files-to-add folder then just run the commands in order (1,2,3)
The script DOES clear out the folders if you select to clean it out. This script was tested using Cyanogenmod7 and it worked great. I am now running nightly 204 with Setcpu/Titaniumbackup pro/and a theme all installed to system. There is no limit for the amount of apps you can install just remember, you have a limited system partition.

How does it work? Read what does it do and if you can't understand that, you shouldn't touch a rooted phone.

Why did you just call me an ass?

It stands for App to system storage!
